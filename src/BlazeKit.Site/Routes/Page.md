    <div>BlazeKit is unopinionated about the Blazor Hosting Model. BlazeKit works with either <strong>Blazor WebApp</strong> or <strong>Blazor WebAssembly</strong> Model.</div>

## 🤔 Why?
Is the Blazor Framework itself not enough to build web apps? It certainly is and the Team at Microsoft has done a awesome job with Blazor.

In my day job i write a lot of C# code and also many Blazor applications when ever a UI is required since Blazor can be used for Desktop apps as well. However, in my spear time i am playing around with the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem and noticed the growing trend of so called Meta-Frameworks to build web apps.

I used SvelteKit in a side project and fell in love with the file-based routing and the reactivity implemented by Svelte.

Back in my day job, i missed these simple features in Blazor. So i sad down and thought how i could address features like file-based routing, file-based layouts and reactivity in the Blazor ecosystem. And here it is ... BlazeKit ✨

Are more features coming to BlazeKit?

I am certainly like to keep working on BlazeKit since i see some oppertunities with the release of .NET 8. Yes, i am looking at you Server-Side-Rendering.
