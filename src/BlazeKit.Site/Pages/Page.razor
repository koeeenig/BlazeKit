<h1>Welcome to BlazeKit! <span class="wave">👋</span></h1>
<p><strong>BlazeKit</strong> aims to provide Meta-framework-like Features for Blazor which has been inspired by <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" target="_blank">SvelteKit</a>. BlazeKit currently supports the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>⚡ Reactive primitives inspired by the signals pattern.</li>
    <li>🪧 File-based Routing</li>
    <li>🖼️ File-based Layouts</li>
    <li>🪄 Auto-Generated Route Parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>Why BlazeKit anyway?!? Is the Blazor Framework itself not enough to build web apps? It certainly is and the Team at Microsoft has done a awesome job with Blazor.</p>
<p>In my day job i write a lot of C# code and also many Blazor applications when ever a UI is required since Blazor can be used for Desktop apps as well.</p>
<p>However, in my spear time i keep an eye on the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem and the growing trend of so called Meta-Frameworks to build web apps. I used <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" target="_blank">SvelteKit</a> in a side project and fell in love with the file-based routing and the reactivity implemented by Svelte.</p>
<p>Back in my day job, i missed these simple features in Blazor. So i sad down and thought how i could address these features in the Blazor ecosystem.</p>

<p>And here it is ... <strong>BlazeKit</strong> ✨</p>

<strong>Are more features coming to BlazeKit?</strong>
<p>I am certainly like to keep working on BlazeKit since i see some oppertunities with the release of .NET 8. Yes, i am looking at you Server-Side-Rendering.</p>
<p>However, the next phase will be focused on the deployment of a Blazor app. There are many Hosting providers like Azure, Vercel, Cloudflare, Netlify just to name a few.
These Hosting Platforms integrate super nicely with meta-frameworks based on the JS/TS ecosystem and provide a realy good developer expirience.</p>
<p>The goal: Deploy a Blazor app by adding a NuGet Package for the specififc platform. 🚀</p>

<p>This is a short list with potential features</p>
<ul>
<li>🚀 Automatic Deployments for</li>
<ul>
    <li>Vercel</li>
    <li>Azure Static Web Apps</li>
    <li>Netlify</li>
    <li>Cloudflare</li>
</ul>
<li>🌩️ Serverless Api Routes</li>
<li>👨‍🎨 Server-Side-Rendering (.NET 8)</li>
</ul>
