# Requirements
Before creating your first BlazeKit project, you should ensure that your local machine has:
- .NET 8 - you can find the download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download){target="_blank"}

That's it üëç

# Create an app using the CLI
After you have installed the required dependencies, the easiest way to get a project up an running is by using the BlazeKit CLI.
```shell
# Install the BlazeKit CLI
dotnet tool install --global BlazeKit.CLI
```
Now simply create your first BlazeKit project by running the following command
```shell
bkit new NextUnicorn
```
You will be prompted to choose one of the Blazor Hosting Models such as **Blazor WebAssembly** or **Blazor WebApp**.
Afterwards a BlazeKit app will be created with the choosen hosting model.
Next **_cd_** into your project folder and run `bkit run dev` to start the .NET development server.
```shell
cd NextUnicorn
bkit run dev
```
And here it is, your first BalzeKit project üéâ

# Updating the BlazeKit CLI
The easiest way to update the BlazeKit CLI is to simply uninstall and reinstall it.
```shell
dotnet tool uninstall -g BlazeKit.CLI
dotnet tool install -g BlazeKit.CLI
```
