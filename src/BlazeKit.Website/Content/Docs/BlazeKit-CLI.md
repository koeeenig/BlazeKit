# Command-Line Interface
The CLI is designed to make getting started with the BlazeKit as easy as possible. It simplifies the process of adding third-party integrations like TailwindCSS, making it a no-brainer even for developers new to the framework.
Furthermore, the CLI simplifies app deployment by providing support for various hosting vendors such as Vercel or Azure. This means you can focus more on building your application and less on the intricacies of deployment.
In summary, the CLI is a powerful tool that accelerates development, simplifies integration and deployment, and ultimately enhances your productivity when building with BlazeKit.
# Install
```sh
# Install the BlazeKit CLI
dotnet tool install --global BlazeKit.CLI
```
# Update
The easiest way to update the BlazeKit CLI is to simply uninstall and reinstall it.
```sh
# Update the BlazeKit CLI
dotnet tool uninstall -g BlazeKit.CLI
dotnet tool install -g BlazeKit.CLI
```
# Create a Project
```sh
bkit new NextUnicorn
```
You will be prompted to choose one of the Blazor Hosting Models such as **Blazor WebAssembly** or **Blazor WebApp**.
Afterwards a BlazeKit app will be created with the choosen hosting model.
Next **_cd_** into your project folder and start .NET's local development server using the **_dotnet watch_** command
```sh
cd NextUnicorn
bkit run dev
```
And here it is, your first BalzeKit project ðŸŽ‰

# Build
Building the is handled by the CLI as well.
```sh
bkit build
```
The default build output directoy is `.blazekit/build`. You can customize the ouput with the `-o` option.
```sh
bkit build -o ./artifacts/static
```
This will build the app into the `./artifacts/static` directory

# Integrations
## TailwindCSS
```sh
bkit add tailwindcss
```
This creates a `tailwind.config.js` file in the current project directory with some default settings. You can customize the configuration if you need to but in most cases you will leave it as is.
